## üìö Explanation

### `palindrome.py`
In this program, the `re` package is imported to handle regular expressions. The `is_palindrome` function is a user-defined function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome while ignoring spaces and special characters.

#### **How the program works:**
1. The program prompts the user to enter a string.
2. It prints the original input string.
3. Using `re.sub(r'[^A-Za-z0-9]', "", input_string).lower()`, the program removes all non-alphanumeric characters and converts the string to lowercase for uniform comparison.
4. The cleaned string is reversed using `[::-1]`.
5. Both the cleaned and reversed strings are printed.
6. An `if-else` statement checks whether the cleaned string and its reversed version are the same. If they match, it prints that the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it states that it is not.
7. The condition `if __name__ == "__main__": is_palindrome()` ensures that the function runs only when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.

This approach ensures that punctuation, spaces, and case differences do not affect the palindrome check.
