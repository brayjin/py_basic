## üìö Explanation

### `palindrome.py`
In this program, the `re` package is imported to handle regular expressions. The `is_palindrome` function is a user-defined function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome while ignoring spaces and special characters.

#### **How the program works:**
1. The program prompts the user to enter a string.
2. It prints the original input string.
3. Using `re.sub(r'[^A-Za-z0-9]', "", input_string).lower()`, the program removes all non-alphanumeric characters and converts the string to lowercase for uniform comparison.
4. The cleaned string is reversed using `[::-1]`.
5. Both the cleaned and reversed strings are printed.
6. An `if-else` statement checks whether the cleaned string and its reversed version are the same. If they match, it prints that the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it states that it is not.
7. The condition `if __name__ == "__main__": is_palindrome()` ensures that the function runs only when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.

This approach ensures that punctuation, spaces, and case differences do not affect the palindrome check.

### `large.py`
The `find_large` function is responsible for finding the maximum integer in a given list using Python's built-in `max()` function.

In the `main` function:

- The program continuously prompts the user to enter a list of integers separated by spaces.
- If the user does not enter any input, it asks them to provide at least one integer.
- The input string is split into a list, and each element is converted to an integer using list comprehension.
- If a non-integer value is entered, the program handles the `ValueError` exception and prompts the user to enter valid integers.
- Finally, the largest number in the list is displayed.

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that the script runs only when executed directly, not when imported as a module.

### `unique.py`
The `remove_duplicate` function removes duplicate words from a given list by converting it into a set (which stores only unique values) and then sorting it in ascending order.

#### **How the program works:**
- The user is prompted to enter a list of words separated by spaces.
- Non-alphanumeric characters are removed using the `re.sub()` function, ensuring that only letters, numbers, and spaces remain.
- The cleaned input is split into a list of words.
- The program prints the original list before and after removing duplicates.
- The unique words are sorted alphabetically and displayed.

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that the script runs only when executed directly, not when imported as a module.
